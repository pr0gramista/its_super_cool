# It's Super Cool
PyGame created for [Gynvael's Summer GameDev Challenge 2017](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=657)

### Designed in Raspberry Pi in mind
This game for made for parties and let's face it: you won't bring your $1000 gaming rig to a room full of
drunk people. The PyGame let's you easily modify the game, add controls by GPIO or gamepads (coming soon).

### Multiplayer a lot of multiplayers
You can play with friends by network or on the same machine, just like the old times. 

Protip: you can use multiple keyboards or the one with anti ghosting 

#### Assets
Graphical assets came from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/). It is one of the rule of the contest to use them.

Most of sound effects are made by my friends, but sophisticated ones are from [freesfx.co.uk](http://www.freesfx.co.uk/)
and they are license under their [EULA](http://www.freesfx.co.uk/info/eula/)

## How to play>

- Install Python 3
- Install pygame, you can use `pip install pygame`
- Download the game
- Run server and game (use .bat files only if you have Python 3 accessible by `python` not `python3`)
- Edit `settings.py` to adjust some things

**Play only with people you trust, this game is 0% cheat pr00f.**

### Don't rush with anything, it will crash, derp.
